## SMCLib

Salonia Matteo's C Library (or `SMCLib`) is a C Library written by Salonia Matteo.

### List containing Library names
`color`: refers to the `color.h` Library;

`compiler`: refers to the `compiler.h` and `platform.h` Libraries

`platform`: same as `compiler`

### Compiling an Example
Like I have written in the [README](https://github.com/saloniamatteo/smclib), just run:

```bash
cd smclib/examples
make [example]
```

(where `[example]` is a Library name) to compile an Example that uses the chosen Library.
